```

## Summary

This PR reduces avoidable startup, tool-discovery, session-persistence, and TUI
MCP reload overhead without changing the public tool API.

It does five main things:

1. Keeps platform plugin imports out of normal `model_tools` startup unless a
   gateway/platform path needs them.
2. Makes built-in tool discovery cheaper with a lightweight register detector,
   a persistent fingerprint cache, and adaptive parallel source scanning for
   large future tool directories.
3. Memoizes recursive toolset resolution by registry object and generation.
4. Batches completed-turn session message writes into one SQLite transaction.
5. Makes the TUI reload MCP tools only when the `mcp_servers` config
   fingerprint changes.

The branch also adds a reproducible benchmark harness and focused regression
tests for the new cache, batch, and fingerprint behavior.

## Problem

Several hot paths were doing repeated work:

- `model_tools` startup loaded bundled platform plugins even for plain tool
  schema setup.
- Built-in tool discovery scanned every tool source file each process startup.
- Toolset resolution repeatedly walked nested toolset includes and plugin
  aliases even when the registry had not changed.
- `_flush_messages_to_session_db()` wrote one message at a time, causing one
  SQLite write path and counter update per message.
- The TUI mtime poller called `reload.mcp` for any config change, including
  display/voice edits that do not affect MCP tools.

These costs are especially visible in fresh CLI/TUI/gateway processes and in
tool-heavy agent turns.

## Implementation

### Startup and Plugin Imports

- `hermes_cli/plugins.py` supports `discover_and_load(include_platforms=False)`.
- `model_tools.py` uses the fast path so normal tool-schema setup does not
  import gateway/platform stacks.
- Platform plugins can still be loaded later through the full discovery path.

### Built-In Tool Discovery

- `tools/registry.py` replaces per-file AST parsing with a top-level
  `registry.register(...)` regex detector.
- Built-in discovery now stores a module list cache under Hermes' profile-aware
  cache directory.
- The cache key includes:
  - cache format version
  - absolute `tools/` path
  - each candidate file name
  - each candidate file size
  - each candidate file `st_mtime_ns`
- Cache misses rebuild the module list and refresh the cache.
- Source scanning can use `ThreadPoolExecutor` for large directories, but only
  after a size threshold. Local benchmarking showed the current Hermes `tools/`
  directory is small enough that sequential scanning is faster.
- Tool module imports remain ordered and serial to preserve registration side
  effects.

### Toolset Resolution Cache

- `toolsets.py` now memoizes:
  - `resolve_toolset(name)`
  - `get_all_toolsets()`
  - `get_toolset_names()`
- The cache key is `(id(registry), registry._generation)`, so tests/plugins that
  replace or mutate the registry invalidate safely.
- `create_custom_toolset()` clears the cache.

### SQLite Batch Persistence

- `SessionDB.append_messages(session_id, messages)` inserts multiple messages
  in one write transaction.
- It preserves the same serialization logic as `append_message()` for:
  - structured content
  - `tool_calls`
  - reasoning fields
  - Codex reasoning/message items
- It updates `message_count` and `tool_call_count` once per batch.
- `AIAgent._flush_messages_to_session_db()` builds pending message records and
  uses `append_messages()` when available, with a per-message fallback for
  compatibility.

### TUI MCP Fingerprint

- `tui_gateway/server.py` now includes `mcp_fingerprint` in `config.get mtime`.
- The fingerprint is a stable JSON serialization of the `mcp_servers` config
  section.
- `ui-tui/src/app/useConfigSync.ts` still hydrates full config on any mtime
  change, but calls `reload.mcp` only if the MCP fingerprint changed.
- If the fingerprint is unavailable, the TUI fails open and reloads MCP rather
  than risking stale tools.

### Benchmark Harness

`scripts/benchmark_startup_perf.py` measures fresh subprocess timings for:

- `import model_tools`
- `import model_tools` + `get_tool_definitions`
- warm/cold `get_tool_definitions`
- fast/full plugin discovery
- adaptive source scanning
- cached toolset resolution
- looped vs batched session message inserts

## Benchmarks

Command:

```powershell
python scripts\benchmark_startup_perf.py -n 7
```

Phase 1 baseline was measured from detached `main` at
`a1c316c6f664fa507bb43ea8f91519b390ed9f75` in a separate worktree.

| Case | main median | branch median | Speedup | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `import_model_tools` | 2.0847s | 0.8419s | 2.48x | 59.6% faster |
| `import_and_get_tool_definitions` | 1.8782s | 0.8741s | 2.15x | 53.5% faster |
| `get_tool_definitions` | 0.0918s | 0.0898s | 1.02x | 2.2% faster |
| platform plugin discovery fast path | 0.5571s full baseline | 0.1930s fast path | 2.89x | 65.4% faster |

Later local Windows runs were noisier, so the added Phase 2 cases are more
useful as microbenchmarks:

```powershell
python scripts\benchmark_startup_perf.py -n 3
```

| Case | Median | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `tool_discovery_source_scan_adaptive` | 0.0987s | `parallel_eligible=False`; adaptive guard kept local scan sequential |
| `resolve_toolset_cached` | 0.1610s cold | warm path about 0.000002s/call |
| `session_append_messages_batch` | 0.0240s batch | loop about 0.6329s, about 24.21x faster for 180 messages |

The SQLite batch-write result is the strongest Phase 2 win. Startup subprocess
benchmarks on Windows can vary with filesystem and antivirus activity, so the
PR treats those numbers as local measurements, not universal guarantees.

npm ci
npm test -- useConfigSync.test.ts
npm run type-check
```

Latest focused results:

- `tests/tools/test_registry.py tests/test_toolsets.py tests/test_hermes_state.py`: 271 passed.
- Gateway fingerprint tests: 2 passed.
- `ui-tui` `useConfigSync.test.ts`: 33 passed.
- `ui-tui` type-check: passed.

Known local test environment note:

- `python -m pytest tests\test_tui_gateway_server.py -q -n 0` still has 7
  unrelated failures in this local Python environment because `prompt_toolkit`
  is unavailable to the test process. The new fingerprint tests pass
  independently.

## Reviewer Guide

Recommended review order:

1. `tools/registry.py`
   - Confirm cache fingerprinting invalidates on file changes.
   - Confirm imports remain serial and ordered.
   - Confirm adaptive parallelism is gated by size and does not affect current
     small directories.

2. `toolsets.py`
   - Confirm cache keys include registry identity and generation.
   - Confirm custom toolsets clear memoized results.

3. `hermes_state.py` and `run_agent.py`
   - Compare `append_messages()` field serialization with `append_message()`.
   - Confirm message ordering and session counters are preserved.
   - Confirm fallback to `append_message()` remains available.

4. `tui_gateway/server.py` and `ui-tui/src/app/useConfigSync.ts`
   - Confirm non-MCP config edits still hydrate UI state.
   - Confirm MCP reload happens only when the fingerprint changes or is missing.

5. `scripts/benchmark_startup_perf.py`
   - Confirm benchmark cases are small, local, and do not require network.

## Risk Assessment

Risk: stale built-in tool discovery cache.

Mitigation: cache version, absolute path, file names, sizes, and nanosecond
mtimes are checked before use. Cache misses rebuild from source.

Risk: stale toolset resolution after plugin or registry changes.

Mitigation: cache key includes registry identity and `_generation`; tests cover
registry mutation. Custom toolsets clear the cache.

Risk: SQLite batch write changes message ordering or counters.

Mitigation: batch inserts preserve message order, apply monotonic timestamps
within the batch, and update counters with the same tool-call counting semantics
as `append_message()`. Tests cover message order and counter behavior.

Risk: TUI misses an MCP reload.

Mitigation: missing/invalid fingerprints fail open and trigger reload. Backend
fingerprint is stable JSON of `mcp_servers`.

Risk: parallel scanning changes registration side effects.

Mitigation: only source detection is parallel. Module imports remain serial and
ordered.

## Rollback Plan

Each optimization can be reverted independently:

- Disable persistent tool discovery cache by removing cache read/write calls in
  `discover_builtin_tools()`.
- Disable toolset memoization by bypassing `_RESOLVED_TOOLSET_CACHE`,
  `_ALL_TOOLSETS_CACHE`, and `_TOOLSET_NAMES_CACHE`.
- Disable SQLite batch writes by making `_flush_messages_to_session_db()` call
  `append_message()` in the loop again.
- Disable TUI MCP fingerprinting by restoring unconditional `reload.mcp` on
  config mtime changes.
- Disable adaptive parallel scanning by forcing
  `_should_parallel_scan_tool_sources()` to return `False`.

## Out Of Scope

This PR does not implement:

- a full tool schema manifest that avoids importing tool modules entirely
- plugin manifest disk caching
- skill snapshot caching for external skill dirs
- denormalized session-list preview fields
- adaptive `/goal` judge cadence
- CI performance budgets

Those are good follow-up PRs after this safer hot-path pass lands.
